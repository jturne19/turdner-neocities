                <p>
                    I recently built a small custom TODO app written in Rust to 1.) learn and use Rust, 2.) satisfy my
                    needs for a simple TODO app for work. I searched around for a simple TODO app which would show a
                    small GUI window with my TODOs, allow me to checkmark them, and not do any fancy internet garbage.
                    Most TODO apps I found, while cool, were way too complicated (<a
                        href="https://www.todoist.com/"
                        target="_blank"
                        >todoist</a
                    >, Microsoft To Do) or only have TUI/cli interface which is not what I want to use on my (windows)
                    work laptop. I also see people do dumb nerd things where they keep a todo text file somewhere and
                    rsync or sycnth it to different machines or some such stuff. Not really what I am looking for to
                    keep track of tasks at work.

                    <code>todors</code> (pronouced like tudors?) lets users enter new TODOs using the input box and it
                    adds them to the TODO list. When a TODO item is checkmarked, it is sent down to the DONEs list which
                    is collapsable. You can uncheckmark a DONE and it will go back to the TODOs. Both TODOs and DONEs
                    are stored in separate markdown files in the directory <code>$HOME/.todors</code> as
                    <code>todos.md</code> and <code>done_todos.md</code>. As TODOs and DONEs are made, these files are
                    updated. Upon opening <code>todors</code>, these Markdown files are loaded. This allows for the
                    flexibility of editing the Markdown files directly which will then show up in the GUI display. A
                    TODO for this project is for the files to be loaded dynamically on any change so the changes show up
                    in real-time. I'll get to that eventually. The DONEs saved in the done_todos.md file include a
                    date-stamp for when the task was completed. Handy for looking back and seeing what you've done and
                    when!

                    <code>todors</code> is dead simple, baby's first Rust code. It's just a single file. It uses the
                    <a href="https://github.com/emilk/egui" target="_blank">egui</a> library for the GUI elements.
                    There's really nothing fancy going on.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A great aspect for Rust is the ease of cross-compiling. It really is just a "<code
                        >cargo build --release</code
                    >" to build it on Linux or Windows. I wrote it on my linux puter but compile and use it on my work
                    windows laptop. I haven't tried it yet but I think it's really simple to build the executables for
                    different target architectures from a single dev environment. Another TODO for
                    <code>todors</code> is to put some releases out on the github.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Other TODOs for <code>todors</code> is to allow for user-settable locations for saving the TODOs and
                    DONEs and for user-settable color configuration. That way you can customize the look and match your
                    colorschemes. Currently it just does the default egui dark/light them depending on your computer's
                    current theme (or at least them at startup of <code>todors</code>, idk I haven't tested it).

                    Leave a comment or whatever on github if you have feedback! It's open source so you can fork it and
                    upgrade things as you'd like and put in a pull request!
